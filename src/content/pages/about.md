Web-X Marketing is a reliable and trustworthy marketing agency, and we will continue to help startups grow their businesses.

# Marketing Consultancy

If you're struggling to get your marketing back on track, I may be able to help. As a marketing consultant, I offer hourly, half-day, or day rates to come in and provide expert guidance based on my years of experience. I've worked with businesses of all shapes and sizes, so I'm familiar with the challenges that Freelancers, small businesses, professional service firms, and corporations often face. 

My consulting services are flexible and can be tailored to whatever you need. For example, I could provide a one-hour brainstorming session over Zoom, Skype, or Whatsapp. Or, if you're working on a new campaign, you might need a half-day session in your office with your team.
